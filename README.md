# Just-a-beginner-Log-In-Detector
This is a python code that allows the user to sign up and sign in.....without actually saving the entries to a text file. It's a beginner project, just so I could enhance my skills on functions and strings.The last part of the code does not properly work, and it does not confirm, so if anyone could help then please do and Please don't Judge.
